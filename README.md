#  GearFaceAR

The [ARGear](https://www.argear.io) team contacted me to test their SDK. I created _GearFaceAR_ to test the filters that ARGear provided.

![test 1](https://github.com/OscarSantosGH/GearFaceAR/blob/main/images/test1.gif?raw=true "Test Gif 1")
![test 2](https://github.com/OscarSantosGH/GearFaceAR/blob/main/images/test2.gif?raw=true "Test Gif 2")

## Libraries

* [ARGear](https://www.argear.io) to apply filters and face modifications.
* [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) for face tracking.
