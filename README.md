#  GearFaceAR

The [ARGear](https://www.argear.io) team contacted me to test there SDK. I created _GearFaceAR_ to test the filters that ARGear provided.


## Libraries

* [ARGear](https://www.argear.io) to apply filters and face modifications.
* [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) for face tracking.
